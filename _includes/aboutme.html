    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>JavaScript fanatic thriving on the landscape that is full stack engineering. The data flow from client to server to database and everything in between fascinates me. The unforeseen bugs that take me hours (or days...) to figure out, elegant modularization of code, and beautiful UI/UX are what drives me every day in the madness that is JavaScript development.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I build intuitive and performant applications with a variety of web tech stacks. React, React-Native, Angular, NodeJS, MySql, MongoDB. If it can build an app, I'll find a way to code it. I solve complex problems while maintaining readable code. Keeping things modular and especially testable are coding traits I pride myself on and strive to improve everyday.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I consistently provide a detailed and diligent approach to resolving challenges. I'm ambitious, I love new challenges, and look forward to opportunites for growth.</p>
